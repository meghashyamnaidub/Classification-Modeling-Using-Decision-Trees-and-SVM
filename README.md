# Classification-Modeling-of-Bank-Term-Subscriptions-Using-Decision-Trees-Random-Forest-and-SVM
As a part of this project, I have worked on

• Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing.

• Modeling a classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not, using SVM, Decision Trees, and XGBoost models.

• Plotting and interpreting the learning curves to find the optimal parameters for the above-mentioned models.
